# Twinmoji
Twinmoji is a fun and challenging game available in two exciting modes: Single Player and Battle Mode. 
  - In Single Player mode, test your speed and sharpness to find the identical emoji, between two cards (each containing up to 12 emojis), before time runs out.
  - In Battle Mode, compete head-to-head with another player to spot the only identical emoji.
